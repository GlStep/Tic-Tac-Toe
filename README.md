# Tic-Tac-Toe
 
This is a personal project by me just to improve my abilities in programming. This simple project involves the languages C++ and Rust. I am thinking about adding further languages in the future.

## Tic Tac Toe Version 1 (C++)

This is a simple version of the game written in C++. Because this was my first try on a slightly larger project, and I was relatively new to the language, I was not familiar with the proper usage of classes in C++.

## Tic Tac Toe Version 2 (C++)

This is the second try at the project with proper knowledge of classes in C++.
